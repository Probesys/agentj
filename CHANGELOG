# v2.0.0

This release brings a main new feature: outgoing mails management. AgentJ
can now be set as relay of an SMTP server, which allows to
- configure send quota (for domains, groups or users)
- prevent unwanted sent mail: spams, virus, eg by a compromised mail account
- get mail alerts for quota overrun/blocked outgoing spam or virus
- get statistics about sent/received mails
