**AgentJ** is designed to protect your already existing mail server from spam, fishing and other malicious mail you and users of your organisation may receive.  
All your incoming mails will be intercepted and blocked if needed. Legitimate mails for which an human can confirm sending will be delivered directly to your inbox, and for all the other mails, you'll be able to manually choose what to do.

AgentJ is a [Probesys](https://www.probesys.coop) project, made available under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.
