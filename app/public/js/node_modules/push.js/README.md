> ## Important Notice
> Push is currently looking for co-maintainers of the repo. The guy who originally made this library, [Tyler Nickerson](https://tylernickerson.com), while still visiting this repo from time to time, is busy trying to work on his company [Linguistic](https://github.com/linguistic) right now. As a result, he may not have time to answer everyone or fix bugs as quickly as they would like him too. If you find it pretty easy to find your way around this code and think you could help some people out, shoot me a message at [nickersoft@gmail.com](mailto:nickersoft@gmail.com) and let's talk.

### What is Push? ###

Push is the fastest way to get up and running with Javascript desktop notifications. A fairly new addition to the
official specification, the Notification API allows modern browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and IE 9+ to push
notifications to a user's desktop. Push acts as a cross-browser solution to this API, falling back to use  older
implementations if the user's browser does not support the new API.

You can quickly install Push via [npm](http://npmjs.com):

```
npm install push.js --save
```

Or, if you want something a little more lightweight, you can give [Bower](http://bower.io) a try:

```
bower install push.js --save
```

### Full Documentation ###
Full documentation for Push can be found at the project's new homepage [https://pushjs.org](https://pushjs.org).
See you there!
