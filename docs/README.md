# AgentJ documentation

AgentJ is intended to be set as your email domain MX, and as relay for your SMTP server.
It sends emails from the web domain and, depending on the configuration, from your email domain.
Users authentication can be made via IMAP, LDAP or Microsoft Azure.

## Infrastructure overview

AgentJ runs over Docker images.
You can learn more by opening the file [`docker-compose.yml`](/docker-compose.yml).

Services:

- **app**: the AgentJ web interface (configuration for admins, usage for users)
- **db**: a MariaDB instance to store emails, domains configuration, users info, DKIM keys, authorized/banned senders, Amavis scoresâ€¦
- **smtp**: a postfix instance that will receive the incoming emails and check them using **amavis** container
- **outsmtp**: a postfix instance that will handle outgoing emails, sent by local users (via their original smtp server) and check them using **outamavis**
- **amavis**: a container running Amavis/Spamassassin
- **outamavis**: same as **amavis** but used for outgoing emails sent by local users
- **opendkim**: verify incoming email DKIM signature for incoming email, and append signature for outgoing email
- **policyd-rate-limit**: rate limiting service used by **outsmtp**, get policies from **db**
- **senderverifmilter**: custom postfix milter to secure multi-domains AgentJ instances
- **clamav** (optional): ClamAV instance used by both amavis containers. An external instance can be used instead

Services used during dev/tests:

- **ldap**: runs an OpenLDAP server
- **mailpit**: catches all emails, from or to AgentJ
- **smtptest**: runs opensmtpd and dnsmasq. It can send email to AgentJ on the behalf of configured domains; relay email from AgentJ to mailpit, provide DNS for correct DKIM verification of tests email

Volumes:

- **db** : MariaDB database files
- **amavis_in** and **amavis_out** : Amavis databases
- **postqueue** : the incoming email queue (for **smtp**)
- **outpostqueue** : the outgoing email queue (for **outsmtp**)

## Production

### Usage

Get the code:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Probesys/agentj.git
$ cd agentj
```

Checkout to the latest version (see [releases](https://github.com/Probesys/agentj/releases)):

```console
$ git checkout <VERSION>
```

Configure the application:

```console
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to your needs.
The file is commented to help you to change it.

Then start the Docker stack:

```console
$ docker compose up
```

> [!CAUTION]
> It is not recommended to launch the stack as root.
> We recommend you to create a dedicated `docker` user (make sure it belongs to the `docker` group).

You can then access the web interface to configure your email domain.

### Upgrade

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always backup your data (database and volumes) and check the [changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) **before** beginning the upgrade process.
> Breaking changes are highlighted in the migration notes for each version.

Update the code to the latest version (see [releases](https://github.com/Probesys/agentj/releases)):

```console
$ git fetch
$ git checkout <VERSION>
```

Update the `VERSION` variable in the `.env` file and adapt other variables accordingly to the migration notes.

Restart the stack:

```console
$ docker compose pull
$ docker compose up -d
```

### Versioning policy

Versions of AgentJ are following this pattern: `major.minor.patch`.
For instance, version 2.1.0 means 2 is major, 1 is minor and 0 is patch.

Major and minor versions can introduce breaking changes in the configuration so it's strongly recommended to check the changelog before such upgrade.
It is safe to upgrade to patch versions automatically, although it is preferable to always check the changelog.

For now, we only provide maintenance and security fixes for the latest minor version.

We don't commit to a specific release schedule, but you can expect ~3 minor or major versions per year.

## Development

Get the code:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:Probesys/agentj.git
$ cd agentj
```

Start the application:

```console
$ make docker-start
```

The command automatically setup an `.env` file suitable for development.

Login to [localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090) with the credentials `admin` / `secret`.

### Working in the Docker containers

There are few scripts to allow to execute commands in the Docker containers easily:

```
$ ./scripts/php
$ ./scripts/composer
$ ./scripts/console
$ ./scripts/yarn
$ ./scripts/mariadb
```

### Update the Docker images

You can rebuild and pull the images manually with:

```console
$ make docker-images
```

### Run the linters

Execute the linters with:

```console
$ make lint
```

You can run a specific linter with:

```console
$ make lint LINTER=phpstan
$ make lint LINTER=phpcs
$ make lint LINTER=symfony
```

### Clean your Docker environment

Sometimes, you may need to rebuild your environment from scratch.
You can remove all the Docker stuff (containers, volumes, networks) with:

```console
$ make docker-clean FORCE=true
```

### Working with LDAP

The development stack provides a LDAP server.
To use it, you must create a `example.com` domain in AgentJ.

Then, create a LDAP connector with the following values:

- host: `ldap`
- port: 1389
- bind DN: `cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com`
- password: `secret`
- BaseDN: `ou=users,dc=example,dc=com`
- Login field: `uid`
- Name field: `displayName`
- Email field: `mail`
- Users filter: `(cn=*)`

Then, import the users.
You can login with one of the LDAP users:

- `alix@example.com` / `secret`
- `benedict@example.com` / `secret`
- `charlie@example.com` / `secret`
- `dominique@example.com` / `secret`

### About the `compose.dev.yml` file

This file is used to override the Docker Compose configuration in development:

- it starts [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org)
- it mounts the code from your local `app/` folder into the app container
- it exposes the database port to the host
- it sets static IPs and specify DNS for some containers

### Managing version branches

For each minor version of AgentJ, we create a dedicated Git "patch" branch (e.g. [branch `2.1`](https://github.com/Probesys/agentj/tree/2.1)).
This allows to release patch versions while working on major features on the `main` branch.

Generally speaking, if you work on a new feature, start your branch from `main`.
If you work on a bugfix, you should start your branch from the latest patch branch.
Some maintenance tasks may also start from the patch branch if it can be helpful.
Pull requests must target the corresponding branch.

Maintainers must synchronize as often as possible the `main` branch with the latest patch branch by creating a branch from `main` and merge the patch branch in it.
Then, follow the normal workflow by opening a pull request.
