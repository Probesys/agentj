# Versioning policy

Versions of AgentJ are following this pattern: `major.minor.patch`.
For instance, version 2.1.0 means 2 is major, 1 is minor and 0 is patch.

Major and minor versions can introduce breaking changes in the configuration so it's strongly recommended to check the changelog before such upgrade.
It is safe to upgrade to patch versions automatically, although it is preferable to always check the changelog.

For now, we only provide maintenance and security fixes for the latest minor version.

We don't commit to a specific release schedule, but you can expect ~3 minor or major versions per year.
