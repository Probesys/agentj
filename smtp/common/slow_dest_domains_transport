# Specific transport for slow destination domains.
# A slow destination domain considers postfix default delivery rate too fast.
# It will answer "SMTP 4XX" after a few emails if you don't setup a quite high
# rate delay.
# It needs a specific transport not to clog your outgoing queue because of a
# destination_rate_delay >= 30s.
# **IMPORTANT:** this slow_dest_domains_tranport hash is "french-centric".
# It needs to be adapted to fit your local internet landscape if your
# organization is outside of France.
